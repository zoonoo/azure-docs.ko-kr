# <a name="install-on-premises-data-gateway-for-azure-logic-apps"></a>Azure Logic Apps에 온-프레미스 데이터 게이트웨이 설치

Before you can [connect to on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md), download and install the [on-premises data gateway](https://aka.ms/on-premises-data-gateway-installer) on a local computer. The gateway works as a bridge that provides quick data transfer and encryption between data sources on premises and your logic apps. You can use the same gateway installation with other cloud services, such as Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Azure Analysis Services. For information about how to use the gateway with these services, see these articles:

* [Microsoft Power Automate on-premises data gateway](/power-automate/gateway-reference)
* [Microsoft Power BI 온-프레미스 데이터 게이트웨이](/power-bi/service-gateway-onprem)
* [Microsoft Power Apps on-premises data gateway](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/gateway-reference)
* [Azure Analysis Services 온-프레미스 데이터 게이트웨이](../analysis-services/analysis-services-gateway.md)

This article shows how to download, install, and set up your on-premises data gateway so that you can access on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps. You can also learn more about [how the data gateway works](#gateway-cloud-service) later in this topic. For more information about the gateway, see [What is an on-premises gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem)?

<a name="requirements"></a>

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>전제 조건

* Azure 계정 및 구독 If you don't have an Azure account with a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

  * Your Azure account must belong to a single [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant or directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md#terminology). You must use the same Azure account for installing and administering the gateway on your local computer.

  * During gateway installation, you sign in with your Azure account, which links your gateway installation to your Azure account and only that account. Later, in the Azure portal, you must use the same Azure account and Azure AD tenant when you create an Azure gateway resource that registers and claims your gateway installation. In Azure Logic Apps, on-premises triggers and actions then use the gateway resource for connecting to on-premises data sources.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can link only one gateway installation and one Azure gateway resource to each other. You can't link the same gateway installation to multiple Azure accounts or Azure gateway resources. However, an Azure account can link to multiple gateway installations and Azure gateway resources. In an on-premises trigger or action, you can select from your various Azure subscriptions, and then select an associated gateway resource.

  * You need to sign in with either a work account or school account, also known as an *organization* account, which looks like `username@contoso.com`. You can't use Azure B2B (guest) accounts or personal Microsoft accounts, such as @hotmail.com or @outlook.com.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you signed up for an Office 365 offering and didn't provide your work email address, your address might look like `username@domain.onmicrosoft.com`. Your account is stored within a tenant in an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In most cases, the User Principal Name (UPN) for your Azure AD account is the same as your email address.
    >
    > To use a [Visual Studio Standard subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) that's linked to a Microsoft account, first [create a tenant in Azure AD](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) or use the default directory. Add a user with a password to the directory, and then give that user access to your Azure subscription. 그런 다음 이 사용자 이름 및 암호를 사용하여 게이트웨이 설치 중에 로그인할 수 있습니다.

* 로컬 컴퓨터에 대한 요구 사항은 다음과 같습니다.

  **최소 요구 사항**

  * .NET Framework 4.7.2
  * 64비트 버전의 Windows 7 또는 Windows Server 2008 R2 이상

  **권장 요구 사항**

  * 8코어 CPU
  * 8GB 메모리
  * 64-bit version of Windows Server 2012 R2 or later
  * Solid-state drive (SSD) storage for spooling

  > [!NOTE]
  > The gateway doesn't support Windows Server Core.

* **Related considerations**

  * Install the on-premises data gateway only on a local computer, not a domain controller. 데이터 원본과 동일한 컴퓨터에 게이트웨이를 설치할 필요가 없습니다. You need only one gateway for all your data sources, so you don't need to install the gateway for each data source.

    > [!TIP]
    > 대기 시간을 최소화하려면 권한이 있다고 가정하여 가능하면 데이터 원본과 가깝게 또는 동일한 컴퓨터에 게이트웨이를 설치하면 됩니다.

  * Install the gateway on a computer that's on a wired network, connected to the internet, always turned on, and doesn't go to sleep. Otherwise, the gateway can't run, and performance might suffer over a wireless network.

  * If you plan to use Windows authentication, make sure that you install the gateway on a computer that's a member of the same Active Directory environment as your data sources.

  * The region that you select for your gateway installation is the same location that you must select when you later create the Azure gateway resource for your logic app. By default, this region is the same location as your Azure AD tenant that manages your Azure account. However, you can change the location during gateway installation.

  * If you're updating your gateway installation to the latest version, uninstall your current gateway first for a cleaner experience.

  * The gateway has two modes: standard mode and personal mode, which applies only to Power BI. You can't have more than one gateway running in the same mode on the same computer.

  * Azure Logic Apps supports read and write operations through the gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

## <a name="install-data-gateway"></a>데이터 게이트웨이 설치

1. [로컬 컴퓨터에서 게이트웨이 설치 관리자를 다운로드하고 실행합니다](https://aka.ms/on-premises-data-gateway-installer).

1. After the installer opens, select **Next**.

   ![Intro screen for gateway installer](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/gateway-intro-screen.png)

1. Select **On-premises data gateway (recommended)** , which is standard mode, and then select **Next**.

   ![Select run mode for data gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/select-gateway-running-mode.png)

1. Review the minimum requirements, keep the default installation path, accept the terms of use, and then select **Install**.

   ![Review requirements and accept terms of use](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/review-and-accept-terms-of-use.png)

1. After the gateway successfully installs, provide the email address for your Azure account, and then select **Sign in**, for example:

   ![회사 또는 학교 계정으로 로그인](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/sign-in-gateway-install.png)

   Your gateway installation can link to only one Azure account.

1. Select **Register a new gateway on this computer** > **Next**. This step registers your gateway installation with the [gateway cloud service](#gateway-cloud-service).

   ![Register gateway on local computer](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/register-gateway-local-computer.png)

1. 게이트웨이 설치에 대해 다음 정보를 제공합니다.

   * A gateway name that's unique across your Azure AD tenant
   * The recovery key, which must have at least eight characters, that you want to use
   * 복구 키 확인

   ![Provide information for gateway installation](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/gateway-name-recovery-key.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > 복구 키를 저장한 후 안전한 장소에 보관합니다. You need this key if you ever want to change the location, move, recover, or take over a gateway installation.

   Note the option to **Add to an existing gateway cluster**, which you select when you install additional gateways for [high-availability scenarios](#high-availability).

1. Check the region for the gateway cloud service and [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) that's used by your gateway installation. By default, this region is the same location as the Azure AD tenant for your Azure account.

   ![Confirm region for gateway service and service bus](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/confirm-gateway-region.png)

1. To accept the default region, select **Configure**. However, if the default region isn't the one that's closest to you, you can change the region.

   *게이트웨이 설치에 대한 지역을 변경하는 이유는 무엇인가요?*

   예를 들어, 대기 시간을 줄이기 위해 논리 앱과 동일한 지역으로 게이트웨이 지역을 변경할 수 있습니다. 또는 온-프레미스 데이터 원본에 가장 가까운 지역을 선택할 수 있습니다. *Azure의 게이트웨이 리소스*와 논리 앱은 서로 다른 위치에 있을 수 있습니다.

   1. 현재 지역 옆에 있는 **지역 변경**을 선택합니다.

      ![Change the current gateway region](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/change-gateway-service-region.png)

   1. On the next page, open the **Select Region** list, select the region you want, and select **Done**.

      ![Select another region for gateway service](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/select-region-gateway-install.png)

1. Review the information in the final confirmation window. This example uses the same account for Logic Apps, Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate, so the gateway is available for all these services. When you're ready, select **Close**.

   ![Confirm data gateway information](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/finished-gateway-default-location.png)

1. Now [create the Azure resource for your gateway installation](../logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

## <a name="check-or-adjust-communication-settings"></a>Check or adjust communication settings

The on-premises data gateway depends on [Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md) for cloud connectivity and establishes the corresponding outbound connections to the gateway's associated Azure region. If your work environment requires that traffic goes through a proxy or firewall to access the internet, this restriction might prevent the on-premises data gateway from connecting to the gateway cloud service and Azure Service Bus. The gateway has several communication settings, which you can adjust. 자세한 내용은 다음 항목을 참조하세요.

* [Adjust communication settings for the on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-communication)
* [Configure proxy settings for the on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-proxy)

<a name="high-availability"></a>

## <a name="high-availability-support"></a>고가용성 지원

To avoid single points of failure for on-premises data access, you can have multiple gateway installations (standard mode only) with each on a different computer, and set them up as a cluster or group. That way, if the primary gateway is unavailable, data requests are routed to the second gateway, and so on. Because you can install only one standard gateway on a computer, you must install each additional gateway that's in the cluster on a different computer. All the connectors that work with the on-premises data gateway support high availability.

* You must already have at least one gateway installation with the same Azure account as the primary gateway and the recovery key for that installation.

* 기본 게이트웨이에서는 2017년 11월 또는 이후의 게이트웨이 업데이트가 실행되고 있어야 합니다.

After you set up your primary gateway, when you go to install another gateway, select **Add to an existing gateway cluster**, select the primary gateway, which is the first gateway that you installed, and provide the recovery key for that gateway. 자세한 내용은 참조 [온-프레미스 데이터 게이트웨이에 대한 고가용성 클러스터](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install#add-another-gateway-to-create-a-cluster)를 참조하세요.

<a name="update-gateway-installation"></a>

## <a name="change-location-migrate-restore-or-take-over-existing-gateway"></a>위치 변경, 기존 게이트웨이 마이그레이션, 복원 또는 인수

게이트웨이 위치를 변경하거나, 게이트웨이 설치를 새 컴퓨터로 이동하거나, 손상된 게이트웨이를 복구하거나, 기존 게이트웨이에 대한 소유권을 가져와야 할 경우 게이트웨이 설치 동안 제공된 복구 키가 필요합니다.

1. Run the gateway installer on the computer that has the existing gateway. If you don't have the latest gateway installer, [download the latest gateway version](https://aka.ms/on-premises-data-gateway-installer).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Before you restore the gateway on the computer that has the original gateway installation, you must first uninstall the gateway on that computer. This action disconnects the original gateway.
   > If you remove or delete a gateway cluster for any cloud service, you can't restore that cluster.

1. After the installer opens, sign in with the same Azure account that was used to install the gateway.

1. Select **Migrate, restore, or takeover an existing gateway** > **Next**, for example:

   ![Migrate, restore, or takeover an existing gateway(기존 게이트웨이 마이그레이션, 복원 또는 인수) 선택](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/migrate-recover-take-over-gateway.png)

1. Select from the available clusters and gateways, and enter the recovery key for the selected gateway, for example:

   ![Select gateway and provide recovery key](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/select-existing-gateway.png)

1. To change the region, select **Change Region**, and select the new region.

1. When you're ready, select **Configure** so that you can finish your task.

## <a name="tenant-level-administration"></a>Tenant-level administration

To get visibility into all the on-premises data gateways in an Azure AD tenant, global administrators in that tenant can sign in to the [Power Platform Admin center](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com) as a tenant administrator and select the **Data Gateways** option. For more information, see [Tenant-level administration for the on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-tenant-level-admin).

<a name="restart-gateway"></a>

## <a name="restart-gateway"></a>게이트웨이 다시 시작

By default, the gateway installation on your local computer runs as a Windows service account named "On-premises data gateway service". However, the gateway installation uses the `NT SERVICE\PBIEgwService` name for its "Log On As" account credentials and has "Log on as a service" permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Windows service account differs from the account used for connecting to on-premises data sources and from the Azure account that you use when you sign in to cloud services.

Like any other Windows service, you can start and stop the gateway in various ways. For more information, see [Restart an on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-restart).

<a name="gateway-cloud-service"></a>

## <a name="how-the-gateway-works"></a>게이트웨이 작동 원리

Users in your organization can access on-premises data for which they already have authorized access. However, before these users can connect to your on-premises data source, you need to install and set up an on-premises data gateway. Usually, an admin is the person who installs and sets up a gateway. These actions might require Server Administrator permissions or special knowledge about your on-premises servers.

The gateway facilitates quick and secure communication behind-the-scenes-communication. This communication flows between a user in the cloud, the gateway cloud service, and your on-premises data source. 게이트웨이 클라우드 서비스는 데이터 원본 자격 증명 및 게이트웨이 세부 정보를 암호화하고 저장합니다. The service also routes queries and their results between the user, the gateway, and your on-premises data source.

게이트웨이는 방화벽과 함께 작동하며 아웃바운드 연결만 사용합니다. 보안으로 시작하는 모든 트래픽은 게이트웨이 에이전트에서 트래픽을 아웃바운드합니다. The gateway relays data from on-premises sources on encrypted channels through [Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview.md). 이 Service Bus는 게이트웨이와 호출 서비스 간에 채널을 만들지만 데이터를 저장하지는 않습니다. 게이트웨이를 통해 전송되는 모든 데이터는 암호화됩니다.

![Architecture for on-premises data gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-install/how-on-premises-data-gateway-works-flow-diagram.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the cloud service, you might need to set up a data source for the gateway.

These steps describe what happens when you interact with an element that's connected to an on-premises data source:

1. The cloud service creates a query, along with the encrypted credentials for the data source. The service then sends the query and credentials to the gateway queue for processing.

1. The gateway cloud service analyzes the query and pushes the request to Azure Service Bus.

1. Azure Service Bus sends the pending requests to the gateway.

1. The gateway gets the query, decrypts the credentials, and connects to one or more data sources with those credentials.

1. The gateway sends the query to the data source for running.

1. 결과가 데이터 원본에서 게이트웨이로 다시 전송된 후 게이트웨이 클라우드 서비스로 전송됩니다. 게이트웨이 클라우드 서비스에서 해당 결과를 사용합니다.

### <a name="authentication-to-on-premises-data-sources"></a>Authentication to on-premises data sources

A stored credential is used to connect from the gateway to on-premises data sources. Regardless of the user, the gateway uses the stored credential to connect. There might be authentication exceptions for specific services, such as DirectQuery and LiveConnect for Analysis Services in Power BI.

### <a name="azure-active-directory-azure-ad"></a>Azure AD(Azure Active Directory)

Microsoft cloud services use [Azure AD](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) to authenticate users. An Azure AD tenant contains usernames and security groups. Typically, the email address that you use for sign-in is the same as the User Principal Name (UPN) for your account.

### <a name="what-is-my-upn"></a>What is my UPN?

If you're not a domain admin, you might not know your UPN. To find the UPN for your account, run the `whoami /upn` command from your workstation. Although the result looks like an email address, the result is the UPN for your local domain account.

### <a name="synchronize-an-on-premises-active-directory-with-azure-ad"></a>Synchronize an on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD

The UPN for your on-premises Active Directory accounts and Azure AD accounts must be the same. So, make sure that each on-premises Active Directory account matches your Azure AD account. The cloud services know only about accounts within Azure AD. So, you don't need to add an account to your on-premises Active Directory. If the account doesn't exist in Azure AD, you can't use that account.

Here are ways that you can match your on-premises Active Directory accounts with Azure AD.

* Add accounts manually to Azure AD.

  Create an account in the Azure portal or in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Make sure that the account name matches the UPN for the on-premises Active Directory account.

* Synchronize local accounts to your Azure AD tenant by using the Azure Active Directory Connect tool.

  The Azure AD Connect tool provides options for directory synchronization and authentication setup. These options include password hash sync, pass-through authentication, and federation. If you're not a tenant admin or a local domain admin, contact your IT admin to get Azure AD Connect set up. Azure AD Connect ensures that your Azure AD UPN matches your local Active Directory UPN. This matching helps if you're using Analysis Services live connections with Power BI or single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Synchronizing accounts with the Azure AD Connect tool creates new accounts in your Azure AD tenant.
