# <a name="schema-and-data-aggregation-in-traffic-analytics"></a>Schema and data aggregation in Traffic Analytics

트래픽 분석은 클라우드 네트워크의 사용자 및 애플리케이션 작업에 대한 가시성을 제공하는 클라우드 기반 솔루션입니다. 트래픽 분석은 Network Watcher NSG(네트워크 보안 그룹) 흐름 로그를 분석하여 Azure 클라우드 내 트래픽 흐름에 대한 정보를 제공합니다. 트래픽 분석을 사용하면 다음과 같은 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다.

- Azure 구독에서 이루어지는 네트워크 작업을 시각화하고 핫스폿을 식별합니다.
- 열린 포트, 인터넷 액세스를 시도하는 애플리케이션, 불량 네트워크에 연결하는 VM(가상 머신) 같은 정보를 통해 네트워크에 대한 위협을 식별하고 네트워크를 보호합니다.
- Azure 지역 및 인터넷의 트래픽 흐름 패턴을 파악하여 네트워크 성능 및 용량에 맞게 네트워크 배포를 최적화합니다.
- 네트워크에서 연결 실패의 원인이 되는 네트워크 구성 오류를 정확히 파악합니다.
- Know network usage in bytes, packets, or flows.

### <a name="data-aggregation"></a>데이터 집계

1. All  flow logs at an NSG between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t” are captured at one-minute intervals in the storage account as blobs before being processed by Traffic Analytics.
2. Default processing interval of Traffic Analytics is 60 minutes. This means that every 60 mins Traffic Analytics picks blobs from storage for aggregation. If processing interval chosen is 10 mins, Traffic Analytics will pick blobs from storage account after every 10 mins.
3. Flows that have the same Source IP, Destination IP, Destination port, NSG name, NSG rule, Flow Direction, and Transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP) (Note: Source port is excluded for aggregation) are clubbed into a single flow by Traffic Analytics
4. This single record is decorated (Details in the section below) and ingested in Log Analytics by Traffic Analytics.This process can take upto 1 hour max.
5. FlowStartTime_t field indicates the first occurrence of such an aggregated flow (same four-tuple) in the flow log processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”.
6. For any resource in TA, the flows indicated in the UI are total flows seen by the NSG, but in Log Analytics user will see only the single, reduced record. To see all the flows, use the blob_id field,  which can be referenced from Storage. The total flow count for that record will match the individual flows seen in the blob.

The below query helps you looks at all flow logs from on-premises in the last 30 days.
```
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FlowStartTime_t >= ago(30d) and FlowType_s == "ExternalPublic"
| project Subnet_s  
```
To view the blob path for the flows in the above mentioned query, use the query below:

```
let TableWithBlobId =
(AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
   | where SubType_s == "Topology" and ResourceType == "NetworkSecurityGroup" and DiscoveryRegion_s == Region_s and IsFlowEnabled_b
   | extend binTime = bin(TimeProcessed_t, 6h),
            nsgId = strcat(Subscription_g, "/", Name_s),
            saNameSplit = split(FlowLogStorageAccount_s, "/")
   | extend saName = iif(arraylength(saNameSplit) == 3, saNameSplit[2], '')
   | distinct nsgId, saName, binTime)
| join kind = rightouter (
   AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
   | where SubType_s == "FlowLog"  
   | extend binTime = bin(FlowEndTime_t, 6h)
) on binTime, $left.nsgId == $right.NSGList_s  
| extend blobTime = format_datetime(todatetime(FlowIntervalStartTime_t), "yyyy MM dd hh")
| extend nsgComponents = split(toupper(NSGList_s), "/"), dateTimeComponents = split(blobTime, " ")
| extend BlobPath = strcat("https://", saName,
                        "@insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resoureId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/", nsgComponents[0],
                        "/RESOURCEGROUPS/", nsgComponents[1],
                        "/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/", nsgComponents[2],
                        "/y=", dateTimeComponents[0], "/m=", dateTimeComponents[1], "/d=", dateTimeComponents[2], "/h=", dateTimeComponents[3],
                        "/m=00/macAddress=", replace(@"-", "", MACAddress_s),
                        "/PT1H.json")
| project-away nsgId, saName, binTime, blobTime, nsgComponents, dateTimeComponents;

TableWithBlobId
| where SubType_s == "FlowLog" and FlowStartTime_t >= ago(30d) and FlowType_s == "ExternalPublic"
| project Subnet_s , BlobPath
```

The above query constructs a URL to access the blob directly. The URL with place-holders is below:

```
https://{saName}@insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resoureId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscriptionId}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{resourceGroup}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/{nsgName}/y={year}/m={month}/d={day}/h={hour}/m=00/macAddress={macAddress}/PT1H.json

```

### <a name="fields-used-in-traffic-analytics-schema"></a>Fields used in Traffic Analytics schema
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The Traffic Analytics Schema has been updated on 22nd August, 2019. The new schema provides source and destination IPs separately removing need to parse FlowDirection field making queries simpler. </br>
  > FASchemaVersion_s updated from 1 to 2. </br>
  > Deprecated fields: VMIP_s, Subscription_s, Region_s, NSGRules_s, Subnet_s, VM_s, NIC_s, PublicIPs_s, FlowCount_d </br>
  > New fields: SrcPublicIPs_s, DestPublicIPs_s, NSGRule_s </br>
  > Deprecated fields will be available until 22nd November, 2019.

Traffic Analytics is built on top of Log Analytics, so you can run custom queries on data decorated by Traffic Analytics and set alerts on the same.

Listed below are the fields in the schema and what they signify

### <a name="notes"></a>참고

1. In case of AzurePublic and ExternalPublic flows, the customer owned Azure VM IP is populated in VMIP_s field, while the Public IP addresses are being populated in the PublicIPs_s field. For these two flow types, we should use VMIP_s and PublicIPs_s instead of SrcIP_s and DestIP_s fields. For AzurePublic and ExternalPublicIP addresses, we aggregate further, so that the number of records ingested to customer log analytics workspace is minimal.(This field will be deprecated soon and we should be using SrcIP_ and DestIP_s depending on whether azure VM was the source or the destination in the flow)
1. Details for flow types: Based on the IP addresses involved in the flow, we categorize the flows in to the following flow types:
1. IntraVNet – Both the IP addresses in the flow reside in the same Azure Virtual Network.
1. InterVNet - IP addresses in the flow reside in the two different Azure Virtual Networks.
1. S2S – (Site To Site) One of the IP addresses belongs to Azure Virtual Network while the other IP address belongs to customer network (Site) connected to the Azure Virtual Network through VPN gateway or Express Route.
1. P2S - (Point To Site) One of the IP addresses belongs to Azure Virtual Network while the other IP address belongs to customer network (Site) connected to the Azure Virtual Network through VPN gateway.
1. AzurePublic - One of the IP addresses belongs to Azure Virtual Network while the other IP address belongs to Azure Internal Public IP addresses owned by Microsoft. Customer owned Public IP addresses won’t be part of this flow type. For instance, any customer owned VM sending traffic to an Azure Service (Storage endpoint) would be categorized under this flow type.
1. ExternalPublic - One of the IP addresses belongs to Azure Virtual Network while the other IP address is a public IP that is not in Azure, is not reported as malicious in the ASC feeds that Traffic Analytics consumes for the processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”.
1. MaliciousFlow - One of the IP addresses belong to azure virtual network while the other IP address is a public IP that is not in Azure and  is reported as malicious in the ASC feeds that Traffic Analytics consumes for the processing interval between “FlowIntervalStartTime_t” and “FlowIntervalEndTime_t”.
1. UnknownPrivate - One of the IP addresses belong to Azure Virtual Network while the other IP address belongs to private IP range as defined in RFC 1918 and could not be mapped by Traffic Analytics to a customer owned site or Azure Virtual Network.
1. Unknown – Unable to map the either of the IP addresses in the flows with the customer topology in Azure as well as on-premises (site).
1. Some field names are appended with \_s or \_d. These do NOT signify source and destination but indicate the data types string and decimal respectively.
