# <a name="import-and-export-blueprint-definitions-with-powershell"></a>Import and export blueprint definitions with PowerShell

Azure Blueprints can be fully managed through Azure portal. As organizations advance in their use of Blueprints, they should start thinking of blueprint definitions as managed code. This concept is often referred to as Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Treating your blueprint definitions as code offers additional advantages beyond what Azure portal offers. These benefits include:

- Sharing blueprint definitions
- Backing up your blueprint definitions
- Reusing blueprint definitions in different tenants or subscriptions
- Placing the blueprint definitions in source control
  - Automated testing of blueprint definitions in test environments
  - Support of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

Whatever your reasons, managing your blueprint definitions as code has benefits. This article shows how to use the `Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact` and `Export-AzBlueprintWithArtifact` commands in the [Az.Blueprint](https://powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Blueprint/) module.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>전제 조건

This article assumes a moderate working knowledge of Azure Blueprints. If you haven't done so yet, work through the following articles:

- [Create a blueprint in the portal](../create-blueprint-portal.md)
- Read about [deployment stages](../concepts/deployment-stages.md) and [the blueprint lifecycle](../concepts/lifecycle.md)
- [Creating](../create-blueprint-powershell.md) and [managing](./manage-assignments-ps.md) blueprint definitions and assignments with PowerShell

아직 설치되지 않은 경우 [Az.Blueprint 모듈 추가](./manage-assignments-ps.md#add-the-azblueprint-module)를 수행하여 PowerShell 갤러리에서 **Az.Blueprint** 모듈을 설치하고 유효성을 검사합니다.

## <a name="folder-structure-of-a-blueprint-definition"></a>Folder structure of a blueprint definition

Before looking at exporting and importing blueprints, let's look at how the files that make up the blueprint definition are structured. A blueprint definition should be stored in its own folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If no value is passed to the **Name** parameter of the `Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact` cmdlet, the name of the folder the blueprint definition is stored in is used.

Along with the blueprint definition, which must be named `blueprint.json`, are the artifacts that the blueprint definition is composed of. Each artifact must be in the subfolder named `artifacts`.
Put together, the structure of your blueprint definition as JSON files in folders should look as follows:

```text
.
|
|- MyBlueprint/  _______________ # Root folder name becomes default name of blueprint definition
|  |- blueprint.json  __________ # The blueprint definition. Fixed name.
|
|  |- artifacts/  ______________ # Subfolder for all blueprint artifacts. Fixed name.
|     |- artifact.json  ________ # Blueprint artifact as JSON file. Artifact named from file.
|     |- ...
|     |- more-artifacts.json

```

## <a name="export-your-blueprint-definition"></a>Export your blueprint definition

The steps to exporting your blueprint definition are straightforward. Exporting the blueprint definition can be useful for sharing, backup, or placing into source control.

- **Blueprint** [required]
  - Specifies the blueprint definition
  - Use `Get-AzBlueprint` to get the reference object
- **OutputPath** [required]
  - Specifies the path to save the blueprint definition JSON files to
  - The output files are in a subfolder with the name of the blueprint definition
- **Version** (optional)
  - Specifies the version to output if the **Blueprint** reference object contains references to more than one version.

1. Get a reference to the blueprint definition to export from the subscription represented as `{subId}`:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   # Login first with Connect-AzAccount if not using Cloud Shell

   # Get version '1.1' of the blueprint definition in the specified subscription
   $bpDefinition = Get-AzBlueprint -SubscriptionId '{subId}' -Name 'MyBlueprint' -Version '1.1'
   ```

1. Use the `Export-AzBlueprintWithArtifact` cmdlet to export the specified blueprint definition:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Export-AzBlueprintWithArtifact -Blueprint $bpDefinition -OutputPath 'C:\Blueprints'
   ```

Once you have either an [exported blueprint definition](#export-your-blueprint-definition) or have a manually created blueprint definition in the [required folder structure](#folder-structure-of-a-blueprint-definition), you can import that blueprint definition to a different management group or subscription.

For examples of built-in blueprint definitions, see the [Azure Blueprint GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-blueprints/tree/master/samples/builtins).

- **Name** [required]
  - Specifies the name for the new blueprint definition
- **InputPath** [required]
  - Specifies the path to create the blueprint definition from
  - Must match the [required folder structure](#folder-structure-of-a-blueprint-definition)
- **ManagementGroupId** (optional)
  - The management group ID to save the blueprint definition to if not the current context default
  - Either **ManagementGroupId** or **SubscriptionId** must be specified
- **SubscriptionId** (optional)
  - The subscription ID to save the blueprint definition to if not the current context default
  - Either **ManagementGroupId** or **SubscriptionId** must be specified

1. Use the `Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact` cmdlet to import the specified blueprint definition:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   # Login first with Connect-AzAccount if not using Cloud Shell

   Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact -Name 'MyBlueprint' -ManagementGroupId 'DevMG' -InputPath 'C:\Blueprints\MyBlueprint'
   ```

Once the blueprint definition is imported, [assign it with PowerShell](./manage-assignments-ps.md#create-blueprint-assignments).

For information about creating advanced blueprint definitions, see the following articles:

- Use [static and dynamic parameters](../concepts/parameters.md).
- Customize the [blueprint sequencing order](../concepts/sequencing-order.md).
- Protect deployments with [blueprint resource locking](../concepts/resource-locking.md).
- [Manage Blueprints as Code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-blueprints/blob/master/README.md).
