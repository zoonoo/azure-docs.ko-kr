# <a name="azure-blockchain-service-security"></a>Azure Blockchain Service security

Azure Blockchain Service는 여러 가지 Azure 기능을 사용하여 데이터를 안전하고 사용 가능하도록 유지합니다. 데이터는 격리, 암호화 및 인증을 사용하여 보안이 유지됩니다.

## <a name="isolation"></a>격리

Azure Blockchain Service resources are isolated in a private virtual network. Each transaction and validation node is a virtual machine (VM). VMs in one virtual network cannot communicate directly to VMs in a different virtual network. Isolation ensures communication remains private within the virtual network. For more information on Azure virtual network isolation, see [isolation in the Azure Public Cloud](../../security/fundamentals/isolation-choices.md#networking-isolation).

## <a name="encryption"></a>암호화

User data is stored in Azure storage. User data is encrypted in motion and at rest for security and confidentiality. For more information, see: [Azure Storage security guide](../../storage/common/storage-security-guide.md).

## <a name="authentication"></a>Authentication

Transactions can be sent to blockchain nodes via an RPC endpoint. Clients communicate with a transaction node using a reverse proxy server that handles user authentication and encrypts data over SSL.

There are three modes of authentication for RPC access.

### <a name="basic-authentication"></a>기본 인증

Basic authentication uses an HTTP authentication header containing the user name and password. User name is the name of the blockchain node. Password is set during provisioning of a member or node. The password can be changed using the Azure portal or CLI.

### <a name="access-keys"></a>액세스 키

Access keys use a randomly generated string included in the endpoint URL. Two access keys help enable key rotation. Keys can be regenerated from the Azure portal and CLI.

### <a name="azure-active-directory"></a>Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) uses a claim-based authentication mechanism where the user is authenticated by Azure AD using Azure AD user credentials. Azure AD provides cloud-based identity management and allows customers to use a single identity across an entire enterprise and access applications on the cloud. Azure Blockchain Service integrates with Azure AD enabling ID federation, single sign-on and multi-factor authentication. You can assign users, groups, and application roles in your organization for blockchain member and node access.

The Azure AD client proxy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-blockchain-connector/releases). The client proxy directs the user to the Azure AD sign-in page and obtains a bearer token upon successful authentication. Subsequently, the user connects an Ethereum client application such as Geth or Truffle to the client proxy's endpoint. Finally, when a transaction is submitted, the client proxy injects the bearer token in the http header and the reverse proxy validates the token using OAuth protocol.

## <a name="keys-and-ethereum-accounts"></a>Keys and Ethereum accounts

When provisioning an Azure Blockchain Service member, an Ethereum account and a public and private key pair is generated. The private key is used to send transactions to the blockchain. The Ethereum account is the last 20 bytes of the public key's hash. The Ethereum account is also called a wallet.

The private and public key pair is stored as a keyfile in JSON format. The private key is encrypted using the password entered when the blockchain ledger service is created.

Private keys are used to digitally sign transactions. In private blockchains, a smart contract signed by a private key represents the signer's identity. To verify the validity of the signature, the receiver can compare the public key of the signer with the address computed from the signature.

Constellation keys are used to uniquely identify a Quorum node. Constellation keys are generated at the time of node provisioning and are specified in the privateFor parameter of a private transaction in Quorum.
