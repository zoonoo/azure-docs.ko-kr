### <a name="step-2-evaluate-the-join-status"></a>2단계: 조인 상태 평가 

다음 필드를 검토하고 예상 값을 갖는지 확인합니다.

#### <a name="domainjoined--yes"></a>DomainJoined : YES  

이 필드는 디바이스가 온-프레미스 Active Directory에 조인되는지 여부를 나타냅니다. 값이 **아니요**인 경우 디바이스는 하이브리드 Azure AD 조인을 수행할 수 없습니다.  

#### <a name="workplacejoined--no"></a>WorkplaceJoined : NO  

이 필드는 디바이스가 Azure AD에 개인 디바이스로 등록되어 있는지 여부를 나타냅니다(*작업 영역 조인*으로 표시). 이 값은 하이브리드 Azure AD 조인된 도메인에 가입된 컴퓨터에 대해 **아니요**이어야 합니다. 값이 **예**인 경우 하이브리드 Azure AD 조인을 완료하기 전에 회사 또는 학교 계정이 추가되었습니다. 이 경우 Windows 10 버전의 1주년 업데이트(1607)를 사용하는 경우 계정은 무시됩니다.

#### <a name="azureadjoined--yes"></a>AzureAdJoined : YES  

이 필드는 디바이스가 Azure AD에 조인되어 있는지 여부를 나타냅니다. 값이 **아니요**인 경우 Azure AD에 대한 조인은 아직 완료되지 않았습니다. 

Proceed to next steps for further troubleshooting.

### <a name="step-3-find-the-phase-in-which-join-failed-and-the-errorcode"></a>Step 3: Find the phase in which join failed and the errorcode

#### <a name="windows-10-1803-and-above"></a>Windows 10 1803 and above

Look for 'Previous Registration' subsection in the 'Diagnostic Data' section of the join status output. This section is displayed only if the device is domain joined and is unable to hybrid Azure AD join.
The 'Error Phase' field denotes the phase of the join failure while 'Client ErrorCode' denotes the error code of the Join operation.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
     Previous Registration : 2019-01-31 09:16:43.000 UTC
         Registration Type : sync
               Error Phase : join
          Client ErrorCode : 0x801c03f2
          Server ErrorCode : DirectoryError
            Server Message : The device object by the given id (e92325d0-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-94ae875d5245) is not found.
              Https Status : 400
                Request Id : 6bff0bd9-820b-484b-ab20-2a4f7b76c58e
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### <a name="older-windows-10-versions"></a>Older Windows 10 versions

Use Event Viewer logs to locate the phase and error code for the join failures.

1. Open the **User Device Registration** event logs in event viewer. Located under **Applications and Services Log** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **User Device Registration**
2. Look for events with the following eventIDs 304, 305, 307.

![Failure Log Event](./media/troubleshoot-hybrid-join-windows-current/1.png)

![Failure Log Event](./media/troubleshoot-hybrid-join-windows-current/2.png)

### <a name="step-4-check-for-possible-causes-and-resolutions-from-the-lists-below"></a>Step 4: Check for possible causes and resolutions from the lists below

#### <a name="pre-check-phase"></a>Pre-check phase

Possible reasons for failure:

- Device has no line of sight to the Domain controller.
   - The device must be on the organization’s internal network or on VPN with network line of sight to an on-premises Active Directory (AD) domain controller.

#### <a name="discover-phase"></a>Discover phase

Possible reasons for failure:

- Service Connection Point (SCP) object misconfigured/unable to read SCP object from DC.
   - A valid SCP object is required in the AD forest, to which the device belongs, that points to a verified domain name in Azure AD.
   - Details can be found in the section [Configure a Service Connection Point](hybrid-azuread-join-federated-domains.md#configure-hybrid-azure-ad-join).
- Failure to connect and fetch the discovery metadata from the discovery endpoint.
   - The device should be able to access `https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net`, in the SYSTEM context, to discover the registration and authorization endpoints. 
   - If the on-premises environment requires an outbound proxy, the IT admin must ensure that the computer account of the device is able to discover and silently authenticate to the outbound proxy.
- Failure to connect to user realm endpoint and perform realm discovery. (Windows 10 version 1809 and later only)
   - The device should be able to access `https://login.microsoftonline.com`, in the SYSTEM context, to perform realm discovery for the verified domain and determine the domain type (managed/federated).
   - If the on-premises environment requires an outbound proxy, the IT admin must ensure that the SYSTEM context on the device is able to discover and silently authenticate to the outbound proxy.

**Common error codes:**

- **DSREG_AUTOJOIN_ADCONFIG_READ_FAILED** (0x801c001d/-2145648611)
   - Reason: Unable to read the SCP object and get the Azure AD tenant information.
   - Resolution: Refer to the section [Configure a Service Connection Point](hybrid-azuread-join-federated-domains.md#configure-hybrid-azure-ad-join).
- **DSREG_AUTOJOIN_DISC_FAILED** (0x801c0021/-2145648607)
   - Reason: Generic Discovery failure. Failed to get the discovery metadata from DRS.
   - Resolution: Find the suberror below to investigate further.
- **DSREG_AUTOJOIN_DISC_WAIT_TIMEOUT**  (0x801c001f/-2145648609)
   - Reason: Operation timed out while performing Discovery.
   - Resolution: Ensure that `https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net` is accessible in the SYSTEM context. For more information, see the section [Network connectivity requirements](hybrid-azuread-join-managed-domains.md#prerequisites).
- **DSREG_AUTOJOIN_USERREALM_DISCOVERY_FAILED** (0x801c0021/-2145648611)
   - Reason: Generic Realm Discovery failure. Failed to determine domain type (managed/federated) from STS. 
   - Resolution: Find the suberror below to investigate further.

**Common suberror codes:**

To find the suberror code for the discovery error code, use one of the following methods.

##### <a name="windows-10-1803-and-above"></a>Windows 10 1803 and above

Look for 'DRS Discovery Test' in the 'Diagnostic Data' section of the join status output. This section is displayed only if the device is domain joined and is unable to hybrid Azure AD join.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Diagnostic Data                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

     Diagnostics Reference : www.microsoft.com/aadjerrors
              User Context : UN-ELEVATED User
               Client Time : 2019-06-05 08:25:29.000 UTC
      AD Connectivity Test : PASS
