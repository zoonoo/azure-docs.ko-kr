For enterprises that use passwords today and have a shared PC environment, security keys provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Security keys provide improved productivity for workers, and have better security.

This document focuses on enabling security key based passwordless authentication. At the end of this article, you will be able to sign in to web-based applications with your Azure AD account using a FIDO2 security key.
