# <a name="managing-hybrid-environments-with-powershell-in-azure-functions-and-app-service-hybrid-connections"></a>Managing hybrid environments with PowerShell in Azure Functions and App Service Hybrid Connections

The Azure App Service Hybrid Connections feature enables access to resources in other networks. You can learn more about this capability in the [Hybrid Connections](../app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections.md) documentation. This article describes how to use this capability to run PowerShell functions that target an on-premises server. This server can then be used to manage all resources in the on-premises environment from an Azure PowerShell function.


## <a name="configure-an-on-premises-server-for-powershell-remoting"></a>Configure an on-premises server for PowerShell remoting

The following script enables PowerShell remoting, and it creates a new firewall rule and a WinRM https listener. For testing purposes, a self-signed certificate is used. In a production environment, we recommend that you use a signed certificate.

```powershell
# For configuration of WinRM, see
# https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winrm/installation-and-configuration-for-windows-remote-management.

# Enable PowerShell remoting.
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

# Create firewall rule for WinRM. The default HTTPS port is 5986.
New-NetFirewallRule -Name "WinRM HTTPS" `
                    -DisplayName "WinRM HTTPS" `
                    -Enabled True `
                    -Profile "Any" `
                    -Action "Allow" `
                    -Direction "Inbound" `
                    -LocalPort 5986 `
                    -Protocol "TCP"

# Create new self-signed-certificate to be used by WinRM.
$Thumbprint = (New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName $env:COMPUTERNAME  -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My).Thumbprint

# Create WinRM HTTPS listener.
$Cmd = "winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname=""$env:COMPUTERNAME ""; CertificateThumbprint=""$Thumbprint""}"
cmd.exe /C $Cmd
```

## <a name="managing-other-systems-on-premises"></a>Managing other systems on-premises

You can use the connected on-premises server to connect to other servers and management systems in the local environment. This lets you manage your datacenter operations from Azure by using your PowerShell functions. The following script registers a PowerShell configuration session that runs under the provided credentials. These credentials must be for an administrator on the remote servers. You can then use this configuration to access other endpoints on the local server or datacenter.

```powershell
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)

# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."

# Note that ContosoUserPassword is a function app setting, so I can access it as $env:ContosoUserPassword.
$UserName = "ContosoUser"
$SecuredPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString  $Env:ContosoUserPassword -AsPlainText -Force
$Credential = [System.management.automation.pscredential]::new($UserName, $SecuredPassword)

# This is the name of the hybrid connection Endpoint.
$HybridEndpoint = "finance1"

# The remote server that will be connected to run remote PowerShell commands on
$RemoteServer = "finance2".

Write-Output "Use hybrid connection server as a jump box to connect to a remote machine"

# We are registering an endpoint that runs under credentials ($Credential) that has access to the remote server.
$SessionName = "HybridSession"
$ScriptCommand = {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        $SessionName)

    if (-not (Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $SessionName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue))
    {
        Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $SessionName -RunAsCredential $Using:Credential
    }
}

Write-Output "Registering session on hybrid connection jumpbox"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $HybridEndpoint `
               -Credential $Credential `
               -Port 5986 `
               -UseSSL `
               -ScriptBlock $ScriptCommand `
               -ArgumentList $SessionName `
               -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck)

# Script to run on the jump box to run against the second machine.
$RemoteScriptCommand = {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        $ComputerName)
        # Write out the hostname of the hybrid connection server.
        hostname
        # Write out the hostname of the remote server.
        Invoke-Command -ComputerName $ComputerName -Credential $Using:Credential -ScriptBlock {hostname} `
                        -UseSSL -Port 5986 -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck)
}

Write-Output "Running command against remote machine via jumpbox by connecting to the PowerShell configuration session"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $HybridEndpoint `
               -Credential $Credential `
               -Port 5986 `
               -UseSSL `
               -ScriptBlock $RemoteScriptCommand `
               -ArgumentList $RemoteServer `
               -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck) `
               -ConfigurationName $SessionName
```

Replace the following variables in this script with the applicable values from your environment:
* $HybridEndpoint
* $RemoteServer

In the two preceding scenarios, you can connect and manage your on-premises environments by using PowerShell in Azure Functions and Hybrid Connections. We encourage you to learn more about [Hybrid Connections](../app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections.md) and [PowerShell in functions](./functions-reference-powershell.md).

You can also use Azure [virtual networks](./functions-create-vnet.md) to connect to your on-premises environment through Azure Functions.
