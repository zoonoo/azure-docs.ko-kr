# <a name="azure-functions-powershell-developer-guide"></a>Azure Functions PowerShell developer guide

This article provides details about how you write Azure Functions using PowerShell.

A PowerShell Azure function (function) is represented as a PowerShell script that executes when triggered. Each function script has a related `function.json` file that defines how the function behaves, such as how it's triggered and its input and output parameters. To learn more, see the [Triggers and binding article](functions-triggers-bindings.md). 

Like other kinds of functions, PowerShell script functions take in parameters that match the names of all the input bindings defined in the `function.json` file. A `TriggerMetadata` parameter is also passed that contains additional information on the trigger that started the function.

이 문서에서는 [Azure Functions 개발자 참조](functions-reference.md)를 이미 읽었다고 가정합니다. You should have also completed the [Functions quickstart for PowerShell](functions-create-first-function-powershell.md) to create your first PowerShell function.

## <a name="folder-structure"></a>폴더 구조

The required folder structure for a PowerShell project looks like the following. 이 기본값은 변경 가능합니다. 자세한 내용은 아래의 [scriptFile](#configure-function-scriptfile) 섹션을 참조하세요.

```
PSFunctionApp
 | - MyFirstFunction
 | | - run.ps1
 | | - function.json
 | - MySecondFunction
 | | - run.ps1
 | | - function.json
 | - Modules
 | | - myFirstHelperModule
 | | | - myFirstHelperModule.psd1
 | | | - myFirstHelperModule.psm1
 | | - mySecondHelperModule
 | | | - mySecondHelperModule.psd1
 | | | - mySecondHelperModule.psm1
 | - local.settings.json
 | - host.json
 | - requirements.psd1
 | - profile.ps1
 | - extensions.csproj
 | - bin
```

At the root of the project, there's a shared [`host.json`](functions-host-json.md) file that can be used to configure the function app. Each function has a folder with its own code file (.ps1) and binding configuration file (`function.json`). The name of the function.json file's parent directory is always the name of your function.

Certain bindings require the presence of an `extensions.csproj` file. Binding extensions, required in [version 2.x](functions-versions.md) of the Functions runtime, are defined in the `extensions.csproj` file, with the actual library files in the `bin` folder. 로컬에서 개발할 때는 [바인딩 확장을 등록](functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles)해야 합니다. Azure Portal에서 함수를 개발할 때 등록이 알아서 수행됩니다.

In PowerShell Function Apps, you may optionally have a `profile.ps1` which runs when a function app starts to run (otherwise know as a *[cold start](#cold-start)* . For more information, see [PowerShell profile](#powershell-profile).

## <a name="defining-a-powershell-script-as-a-function"></a>Defining a PowerShell script as a function

기본적으로 Functions 런타임은 `run.ps1`에서 함수를 찾습니다. 여기서 `run.ps1`는 해당하는 `function.json`과 동일한 부모 디렉터리를 공유합니다.

Your script is passed a number of arguments on execution. To handle these parameters, add a `param` block to the top of your script as in the following example:

```powershell
# $TriggerMetadata is optional here. If you don't need it, you can safely remove it from the param block
param($MyFirstInputBinding, $MySecondInputBinding, $TriggerMetadata)
```

### <a name="triggermetadata-parameter"></a>TriggerMetadata parameter

The `TriggerMetadata` parameter is used to supply additional information about the trigger. The additional metadata varies from binding to binding but they all contain a `sys` property that contains the following data:

```powershell
$TriggerMetadata.sys
```

| 자산   | 설명                                     | Type     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|
| UtcNow     | When, in UTC, the function was triggered        | DateTime |
| MethodName | The name of the Function that was triggered     | 문자열   |
| RandGuid   | a unique guid to this execution of the function | 문자열   |

Every trigger type has a different set of metadata. For example, the `$TriggerMetadata` for `QueueTrigger` contains the `InsertionTime`, `Id`, `DequeueCount`, among other things. For more information on the queue trigger's metadata, go to the [official documentation for queue triggers](functions-bindings-storage-queue.md#trigger---message-metadata). Check the documentation on the [triggers](functions-triggers-bindings.md) you're working with to see what comes inside the trigger metadata.

## <a name="bindings"></a>바인딩

In PowerShell, [bindings](functions-triggers-bindings.md) are configured and defined in a function's function.json. Functions는 다양한 방법으로 바인딩과 상호 작용합니다.

### <a name="reading-trigger-and-input-data"></a>읽기 트리거 및 입력 데이터

Trigger and input bindings are read as parameters passed to your function. Input bindings have a `direction` set to `in` in function.json. The `name` property defined in `function.json` is the name of the parameter, in the `param` block. Since PowerShell uses named parameters for binding, the order of the parameters doesn't matter. However, it's a best practice to follow the order of the bindings defined in the `function.json`.

```powershell
param($MyFirstInputBinding, $MySecondInputBinding)
```

### <a name="writing-output-data"></a>Writing output data

In Functions, an output binding has a `direction` set to `out` in the function.json. You can write to an output binding by using the `Push-OutputBinding` cmdlet, which is available to the Functions runtime. In all cases, the `name` property of the binding as defined in `function.json` corresponds to the `Name` parameter of the `Push-OutputBinding` cmdlet.

The following shows how to call `Push-OutputBinding` in your function script:

```powershell
param($MyFirstInputBinding, $MySecondInputBinding)

Push-OutputBinding -Name myQueue -Value $myValue
```

You can also pass in a value for a specific binding through the pipeline.

```powershell
param($MyFirstInputBinding, $MySecondInputBinding)

Produce-MyOutputValue | Push-OutputBinding -Name myQueue
```

`Push-OutputBinding` behaves differently based on the value specified for `-Name`:

* When the specified name cannot be resolved to a valid output binding, then an error     is thrown.

* When the output binding accepts a collection of values, you can call `Push-OutputBinding` repeatedly to push multiple values.

* When the output binding only accepts a singleton value, calling `Push-OutputBinding` a second time raises an error.

#### <a name="push-outputbinding-syntax"></a>`Push-OutputBinding` syntax

The following are valid parameters for calling `Push-OutputBinding`:

| name | Type | Position | 설명 |
| ---- | ---- |  -------- | ----------- |
| **`-Name`** | string | 1 | The name of the output binding you want to set. |
| **`-Value`** | Object | 2 | The value of the output binding you want to set, which is accepted from the pipeline ByValue. |
| **`-Clobber`** | SwitchParameter | named | (Optional) When specified, forces the value to be set for a specified output binding. | 

The following common parameters are also supported: 
* `Verbose`
* `Debug`
* `ErrorAction`
* `ErrorVariable`
* `WarningAction`
* `WarningVariable`
* `OutBuffer`
* `PipelineVariable`
* `OutVariable` 

For more information, see [About CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

#### <a name="push-outputbinding-example-http-responses"></a>Push-OutputBinding example: HTTP responses

An HTTP trigger returns a response using an output binding named `response`. In the following example, the output binding of `response` has the value of "output #1":

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
    StatusCode = [System.Net.HttpStatusCode]::OK
    Body = "output #1"
})
```

Because the output is to HTTP, which accepts a singleton value only, an error is thrown when `Push-OutputBinding` is called a second time.

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
    StatusCode = [System.Net.HttpStatusCode]::OK
    Body = "output #2"
})
```

For outputs that only accept singleton values, you can use the `-Clobber` parameter to override the old value instead of trying to add to a collection. The following example assumes that you have already added a value. By using `-Clobber`, the response from the following example overrides the existing value to return a value of "output #3":

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
    StatusCode = [System.Net.HttpStatusCode]::OK
    Body = "output #3"
}) -Clobber
```

#### <a name="push-outputbinding-example-queue-output-binding"></a>Push-OutputBinding example: Queue output binding

`Push-OutputBinding` is used to send data to output bindings, such as an [Azure Queue storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue.md#output). In the following example, the message written to the queue has a value of "output #1":

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name outQueue -Value "output #1"
```

The output binding for a Storage queue accepts multiple output values. In this case, calling the following example after the first writes to the queue a list with two items: "output #1" and "output #2".

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name outQueue -Value "output #2"
```

The following example, when called after the previous two, adds two more values to the output collection:

```powershell
PS >Push-OutputBinding -Name outQueue -Value @("output #3", "output #4")
```

When written to the queue, the message contains these four values: "output #1", "output #2", "output #3", and "output #4".

#### <a name="get-outputbinding-cmdlet"></a>`Get-OutputBinding` cmdlet

You can use the `Get-OutputBinding` cmdlet to retrieve the values currently set for your output bindings. This cmdlet retrieves a hashtable that contains the names of the output bindings with their respective values. 

The following is an example of using `Get-OutputBinding` to return current binding values:

```powershell
Get-OutputBinding
```

```Output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
MyQueue                        myData
MyOtherQueue                   myData
```

`Get-OutputBinding` also contains a parameter called `-Name`, which can be used to filter the returned binding, as in the following example:

```powershell
Get-OutputBinding -Name MyQ*
```

```Output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
MyQueue                        myData
```

Wildcards (*) are supported in `Get-OutputBinding`.

## <a name="logging"></a>로깅

Logging in PowerShell functions works like regular PowerShell logging. You can use the logging cmdlets to write to each output stream. Each cmdlet maps to a log level used by Functions.

| Functions logging level | Logging cmdlet |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 오류 | **`Write-Error`** |
| 경고 | **`Write-Warning`**  | 
| 정보 | **`Write-Information`** <br/> **`Write-Host`** <br /> **`Write-Output`**      | 정보 | Writes to _Information_ level logging. |
| 디버그 | **`Write-Debug`** |
| 추적 | **`Write-Progress`** <br /> **`Write-Verbose`** |

In addition to these cmdlets, anything written to the pipeline is redirected to the `Information` log level and displayed with the default PowerShell formatting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the `Write-Verbose` or `Write-Debug` cmdlets is not enough to see verbose and debug level logging. You must also configure the log level threshold, which declares what level of logs you actually care about. To learn more, see [Configure the function app log level](#configure-the-function-app-log-level).

### <a name="configure-the-function-app-log-level"></a>Configure the function app log level

Azure Functions lets you define the threshold level to make it easy to control the way Functions writes to the logs. To set the threshold for all traces written to the console, use the `logging.logLevel.default` property in the [`host.json` file][host.json 참조]. 이 설정은 함수 앱의 모든 함수에 적용됩니다.

The following example sets the threshold to enable verbose logging for all functions, but sets the threshold to enable debug logging for a function named `MyFunction`:

```json
{
    "logging": {
        "logLevel": {
            "Function.MyFunction": "Debug",
            "default": "Trace"
        }
    }
}  
```

자세한 내용은 [host.json 참조]를 참조하세요.

### <a name="viewing-the-logs"></a>Viewing the logs

If your Function App is running in Azure, you can use Application Insights to monitor it. 함수 로그 보기 및 쿼리에 대해 자세히 알아보려면 [Azure Functions 모니터링](functions-monitoring.md)을 읽어보세요.

If you're running your Function App locally for development, logs default to the file system. To see the logs in the console, set the `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `Development` before starting the Function App.

## <a name="triggers-and-bindings-types"></a>Triggers and bindings types

There are a number of triggers and bindings available to you to use with your function app. The full list of triggers and bindings [can be found here](functions-triggers-bindings.md#supported-bindings).

All triggers and bindings are represented in code as a few real data types:

* Hashtable
* 문자열
* byte[]
* int
* Double
* HttpRequestContext
* HttpResponseContext

The first five types in this list are standard .NET types. The last two are used only by the [HttpTrigger trigger](#http-triggers-and-bindings).

Each binding parameter in your functions must be one of these types.

### <a name="http-triggers-and-bindings"></a>HTTP 트리거 및 바인딩

HTTP, 웹후크 트리거 및 HTTP 출력 바인딩은 요청 및 응답 개체를 사용하여 HTTP 메시지를 나타냅니다.

#### <a name="request-object"></a>요청 개체

The request object that's passed into the script is of the type `HttpRequestContext`, which has the following properties:

| 자산  | 설명                                                    | Type                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **`Body`**    | 요청의 본문을 포함하는 개체입니다. `Body` is serialized into the best type based on the data. For example, if the data is JSON, it's passed in as a hashtable. If the data is a string, it's passed in as a string. | object |
| **`Headers`** | A dictionary that contains the request headers.                | Dictionary<string,string><sup>*</sup> |
| **`Method`** | 요청의 HTTP 메서드입니다.                                | 문자열                    |
| **`Params`**  | 요청의 라우팅 매개 변수를 포함하는 개체입니다. | Dictionary<string,string><sup>*</sup> |
| **`Query`** | 쿼리 매개 변수를 포함하는 개체입니다.                  | Dictionary<string,string><sup>*</sup> |
| **`Url`** | 요청의 URL입니다.                                        | 문자열                    |

<sup>*</sup> All `Dictionary<string,string>` keys are case-insensitive.

#### <a name="response-object"></a>응답 개체

The response object that you should send back is of the type `HttpResponseContext`, which has the following properties:

| 자산      | 설명                                                 | Type                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **`Body`**  | 응답의 본문을 포함하는 개체입니다.           | object                    |
| **`ContentType`** | A short hand for setting the content type for the response. | 문자열                    |
| **`Headers`** | 응답 헤더를 포함하는 개체입니다.               | Dictionary or Hashtable   |
| **`StatusCode`**  | 응답의 HTTP 상태 코드입니다.                       | 문자열 또는 int             |

#### <a name="accessing-the-request-and-response"></a>요청 및 응답 액세스

When you work with HTTP triggers, you can access the HTTP request the same way you would with any other input binding. It's in the `param` block.

Use an `HttpResponseContext` object to return a response, as shown in the following:

`function.json`

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "authLevel": "anonymous"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out"
    }
  ]
}
```

`run.ps1`

```powershell
param($req, $TriggerMetadata)

$name = $req.Query.Name

Push-OutputBinding -Name res -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
    StatusCode = [System.Net.HttpStatusCode]::OK
    Body = "Hello $name!"
})
```

The result of invoking this function would be:

```
PS > irm http://localhost:5001?Name=Functions
Hello Functions!
```

### <a name="type-casting-for-triggers-and-bindings"></a>Type-casting for triggers and bindings

For certain bindings like the blob binding, you're able to specify the type of the parameter.

For example, to have data from Blob storage supplied as a string, add the following type cast to my `param` block:

```powershell
param([string] $myBlob)
```

## <a name="powershell-profile"></a>PowerShell 프로필

In PowerShell, there's the concept of a PowerShell profile. If you're not familiar with PowerShell profiles, see [About profiles](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles).

In PowerShell Functions, the profile script executes when the function app starts. Function apps start when first deployed and after being idled ([cold start](#cold-start)).

When you create a function app using tools, such as Visual Studio Code and Azure Functions Core Tools, a default `profile.ps1` is created for you. The default profile is maintained [on the Core Tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/dev/src/Azure.Functions.Cli/StaticResources/profile.ps1) and contains:

* Automatic MSI authentication to Azure.
* The ability to turn on the Azure PowerShell `AzureRM` PowerShell aliases if you would like.

## <a name="powershell-version"></a>PowerShell version

The following table shows the PowerShell version used by each major version of the Functions runtime:

| Functions 버전 | PowerShell version                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1.x               | Windows PowerShell 5.1 (locked by the runtime) |
| 2.x               | PowerShell Core 6                              |

You can see the current version by printing `$PSVersionTable` from any function.

## <a name="dependency-management"></a>종속성 관리

Functions lets you leverage [PowerShell gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) for managing dependencies. With dependency management enabled, the requirements.psd1 file is used to automatically download required modules. You enable this behavior by setting the `managedDependency` property to `true` in the root of the [host.json file](functions-host-json.md), as in the following example:

```json
{
  "managedDependency": {
          "enabled": true
       }
}
```

When you create a new PowerShell functions project, dependency management is enabled by default, with the Azure [`Az` module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) included. The maximum number of modules currently supported is 10. The supported syntax is _`MajorNumber`_ `.*` or exact module version as shown in the following requirements.psd1 example:

```powershell
@{
    Az = '1.*'
    SqlServer = '21.1.18147'
}
```

When you update the requirements.psd1 file, updated modules are installed after a restart.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed dependencies requires access to www.powershellgallery.com to download modules. When running locally, make sure that the runtime can access this URL by adding any required firewall rules. 

The following application settings can be used to change how the managed dependencies are downloaded and installed. Your app upgrade starts within `MDMaxBackgroundUpgradePeriod`, and the upgrade process completes within approximately the `MDNewSnapshotCheckPeriod`.

| Function App setting              | 기본값             | 설명                                         |
|   -----------------------------   |   -------------------     |  -----------------------------------------------    |
| **`MDMaxBackgroundUpgradePeriod`**      | `7.00:00:00` (7 days)     | Each PowerShell worker process initiates checking for module upgrades on the PowerShell Gallery on process start and every `MDMaxBackgroundUpgradePeriod` after that. When a new module version is available in the PowerShell Gallery, it's installed to the file system and made available to PowerShell workers. Decreasing this value lets your function app get newer module versions sooner, but it also increases the app resource usage (network I/O, CPU, storage). Increasing this value decreases the app's resource usage, but it may also delay delivering new module versions to your app. | 
| **`MDNewSnapshotCheckPeriod`**         | `01:00:00` (1 hour)       | After new module versions are installed to the file system, every PowerShell worker process must be restarted. Restarting PowerShell workers affects your app availability as it can interrupt current function execution. Until all PowerShell worker processes are restarted, function invocations may use either the old or the new module versions. Restarting all PowerShell workers complete within `MDNewSnapshotCheckPeriod`. Increasing this value decreases the frequency of interruptions, but may also increase the period of time when function invocations use either the old or the new module versions non-deterministically. |
| **`MDMinBackgroundUpgradePeriod`**      | `1.00:00:00` (1 day)     | To avoid excessive module upgrades on frequent Worker restarts, checking for module upgrades isn't performed when any worker has already initiated that check in the last `MDMinBackgroundUpgradePeriod`. |

Leveraging your own custom modules is a little different than how you would do it normally.

On your local computer, the module gets installed in one of the globally available folders in your `$env:PSModulePath`. When running in Azure, you don't have access to the modules installed on your machine. This means that the `$env:PSModulePath` for a PowerShell function app differs from `$env:PSModulePath` in a regular PowerShell script.

In Functions, `PSModulePath` contains two paths:

* A `Modules` folder that exists at the root of your function app.
* A path to a `Modules` folder that is controlled by the PowerShell language worker.

### <a name="function-app-level-modules-folder"></a>Function app-level `Modules` folder

To use custom modules, you can place modules on which your functions depend in a `Modules` folder. From this folder, modules are automatically available to the functions runtime. Any function in the function app can use these modules. 

> [!NOTE]
> Modules specified in the requirements.psd1 file are automatically downloaded and included in the path so you don't need to include them in the modules folder. These are stored locally in the `$env:LOCALAPPDATA/AzureFunctions` folder and in the `/data/ManagedDependencies` folder when run in the cloud.

To take advantage of the custom module feature, create a `Modules` folder in the root of your function app. Copy the modules you want to use in your functions to this location.

```powershell
mkdir ./Modules
Copy-Item -Path /mymodules/mycustommodule -Destination ./Modules -Recurse
```

With a `Modules` folder, your function app should have the following folder structure:

```
PSFunctionApp
 | - MyFunction
 | | - run.ps1
 | | - function.json
 | - Modules
 | | - MyCustomModule
 | | - MyOtherCustomModule
 | | - MySpecialModule.psm1
 | - local.settings.json
 | - host.json
 | - requirements.psd1
```

When you start your function app, the PowerShell language worker adds this `Modules` folder to the `$env:PSModulePath` so that you can rely on module autoloading just as you would in a regular PowerShell script.

### <a name="language-worker-level-modules-folder"></a>Language worker level `Modules` folder

Several modules are commonly used by the PowerShell language worker. These modules are defined in the last position of `PSModulePath`. 

The current list of modules is as follows:

* [Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive): module used for working with archives, like `.zip`, `.nupkg`, and others.
* **ThreadJob**: A thread-based implementation of the PowerShell job APIs.

By default, Functions uses the most recent version of these modules. To use a specific module version, put that specific version in the `Modules` folder of your function app.

## <a name="environment-variables"></a>환경 변수

Functions에서 [앱 설정](functions-app-settings.md)(예: 서비스 연결 문자열)은 실행 중에 환경 변수로 노출됩니다. You can access these settings using `$env:NAME_OF_ENV_VAR`, as shown in the following example:

```powershell
param($myTimer)

Write-Host "PowerShell timer trigger function ran! $(Get-Date)"
Write-Host $env:AzureWebJobsStorage
Write-Host $env:WEBSITE_SITE_NAME
```

[!INCLUDE [Function app settings](../../includes/functions-app-settings.md)]

로컬로 실행하는 경우 앱 설정은 [local.settings.json](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) 프로젝트 파일에서 읽습니다.

## <a name="concurrency"></a>동시성

By default, the Functions PowerShell runtime can only process one invocation of a function at a time. However, this concurrency level might not be sufficient in the following situations:

* When you're trying to handle a large number of invocations at the same time.
* When you have functions that invoke other functions inside the same function app.

You can change this behavior by setting the following environment variable to an integer value:

```
PSWorkerInProcConcurrencyUpperBound
```

You set this environment variable in the [app settings](functions-app-settings.md) of your Function App.

### <a name="considerations-for-using-concurrency"></a>Considerations for using concurrency

PowerShell is a _single threaded_ scripting language by default. However, concurrency can be added by using multiple PowerShell runspaces in the same process. The amount of runspaces created will match the PSWorkerInProcConcurrencyUpperBound application setting. The throughput will be impacted by the amount of CPU and memory available in the selected plan.

Azure PowerShell uses some _process-level_ contexts and state to help save you from excess typing. However, if you turn on concurrency in your function app and invoke actions that change state, you could end up with race conditions. These race conditions are difficult to debug because one invocation relies on a certain state and the other invocation changed the state.

There's immense value in concurrency with Azure PowerShell, since some operations can take a considerable amount of time. However, you must proceed with caution. If you suspect that you're experiencing a race condition, set the PSWorkerInProcConcurrencyUpperBound app setting to `1` and instead use [language worker process level isolation](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_process_count) for concurrency.

## <a name="configure-function-scriptfile"></a>Configure function `scriptFile`

By default, a PowerShell function is executed from `run.ps1`, a file that shares the same parent directory as its corresponding `function.json`.

The `scriptFile` property in the `function.json` can be used to get a folder structure that looks like the following example:

```
FunctionApp
 | - host.json
 | - myFunction
 | | - function.json
 | - lib
 | | - PSFunction.ps1
```

In this case, the `function.json` for `myFunction` includes a `scriptFile` property referencing the file with the exported function to run.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "../lib/PSFunction.ps1",
  "bindings": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## <a name="use-powershell-modules-by-configuring-an-entrypoint"></a>Use PowerShell modules by configuring an entryPoint

This article has shown PowerShell functions in the default `run.ps1` script file generated by the templates.
However, you can also include your functions in PowerShell modules. You can reference your specific function code in the module by using the `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` fields in the function.json` configuration file.

In this case, `entryPoint` is the name of a function or cmdlet in the PowerShell module referenced in `scriptFile`.

Consider the following folder structure:

```
FunctionApp
 | - host.json
 | - myFunction
 | | - function.json
 | - lib
 | | - PSFunction.psm1
```

Where `PSFunction.psm1` contains:

```powershell
function Invoke-PSTestFunc {
    param($InputBinding, $TriggerMetadata)

    Push-OutputBinding -Name OutputBinding -Value "output"
}

Export-ModuleMember -Function "Invoke-PSTestFunc"
```

In this example, the configuration for `myFunction` includes a `scriptFile` property that references `PSFunction.psm1`, which is a PowerShell module in another folder.  The `entryPoint` property references the `Invoke-PSTestFunc` function, which is the entry point in the module.

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "../lib/PSFunction.psm1",
  "entryPoint": "Invoke-PSTestFunc",
  "bindings": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

With this configuration, the `Invoke-PSTestFunc` gets executed exactly as a `run.ps1` would.

## <a name="considerations-for-powershell-functions"></a>Considerations for PowerShell functions

When you work with PowerShell functions, be aware of the considerations in the following sections.

### <a name="cold-start"></a>콜드 부팅

When developing Azure Functions in the [serverless hosting model](functions-scale.md#consumption-plan), cold starts are a reality. *Cold start* refers to period of time it takes for your function app to start running to process a request. Cold start happens more frequently in the Consumption plan because your function app gets shut down during periods of inactivity.

### <a name="bundle-modules-instead-of-using-install-module"></a>Bundle modules instead of using `Install-Module`

Your script is run on every invocation. Avoid using `Install-Module` in your script. Instead use `Save-Module` before publishing so that your function doesn't have to waste time downloading the module. If cold starts are impacting your functions, consider deploying your function app to an [App Service plan](functions-scale.md#app-service-plan) set to *always on* or to a [Premium plan](functions-scale.md#premium-plan).
