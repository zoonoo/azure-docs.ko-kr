Azure Compute는 특정 하드웨어 유형에서 격리되고 단일 고객 전용인 가상 머신 크기를 제공합니다.  이러한 가상 머신 크기는 규정 준수 및 규정 요구 사항과 같은 요소를 포함하는 작업에 대해 다른 고객으로부터 높은 수준의 격리가 필요한 작업에 가장 적합합니다.  고객은 [중첩된 가상 머신에 대한 Azure 지원](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/)을 사용하여 이러한 격리된 가상 머신의 리소스를 보다 세분화할 수도 있습니다.

격리 크기를 사용하면 가상 머신이 특정 서버 인스턴스에서 하나만 실행되도록 보장합니다.  현재 격리 가상 머신 제품에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
* Standard_E64is_v3
* Standard_E64i_v3
* Standard_M128ms
* Standard_GS5
* Standard_G5
* Standard_DS15_v2
* Standard_D15_v2
* Standard_F72s_v2

You can learn more about each available isolated size [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-memory).

## <a name="retiring-d15_v2ds15_v2-isolation-on-february-15-2020"></a>Retiring D15_v2/DS15_v2 isolation on February 15, 2020
We recently announced the Preview of Azure Dedicated Host, which allows you to run your organization’s Linux and Windows virtual machines on single-tenant physical servers. We plan to fully replace isolated Azure VMs with Azure Dedicated Host. After **February 15, 2020** the D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure VMs may no longer be hardware isolated.

## <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>How does this affect me?
After February 15, 2020, we will no longer provide an isolation guarantee for your D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure virtual machines. 

## <a name="what-actions-should-i-take"></a>What actions should I take?
If hardware isolation is not required for you, there is no action you need to take. 

If isolation is required to you, before February 15, 2020, you would need to either:

•   [Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-azure-dedicated-host) your workload to Azure Dedicated Host Preview

•   [Request access](https://aka.ms/D15iRequestAccess) to a D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2 Azure VM, to get the same price performance. This option is only available for pay-as-you-go and one-year reserved instance scenarios.    

•   [Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resize-virtual-machines/) your workload to another Azure isolated virtual machine.

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ
### <a name="q-why-am-i-not-seeing-the-new-dds15i_v2-sizes-in-the-portal"></a>Q: Why am I not seeing the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes in the portal?
**A**: If you are a current D/DS15_v2 customer and want to use the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes, please fill this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0FTPNXHdWpJlO27GE-bHitUMkZUWEFPNjFPNVgyMkhZS05FSzlPTzRIOS4u)

### <a name="q-why-i-am-not-seeing-any-quota-for-the-new-dds15i_v2-sizes"></a>Q: Why I am not seeing any quota for the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes?
**A**: If you are a current D/DS15_v2 customer and want to use the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes, please fill this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0FTPNXHdWpJlO27GE-bHitUNU1XUkhZWkNXQUFMNEJWUk9VWkRRVUJPMy4u)

### <a name="q-when-are-the-other-isolated-sizes-going-to-retire"></a>Q: When are the other isolated sizes going to retire?
**A**: We will provide reminders 12 months in advance of the official decommissioning of the sizes.

### <a name="q-is-there-a-downtime-when-my-vm-lands-on-a-non-isolated-hardware"></a>Q: Is there a downtime when my vm lands on a non-isolated hardware?
**A**: If you do not need isolation you do not need to take any action and you would not see any downtime.

### <a name="q-are-there-any-cost-changes-for-moving-to-a-non-isolated-virtual-machine"></a>Q: Are there any cost changes for moving to a non-isolated virtual machine?
**A**: No 

### <a name="q-i-already-purchased-1--or-3-year-reserved-instance-for-d15_v2-or-ds15_v2-how-will-the-discount-be-applied-to-my-vm-usage"></a>Q: I already purchased 1- or 3-year Reserved Instance for D15_v2 or Ds15_v2. How will the discount be applied to my VM usage?
**A**: RIs purchased before November 18, 2019 will automatically extend coverage to the new isolated VM series. 

| RI |  Instance Size Flexibility | Benefit eligibility |   
| --- | --- | --- |
|   D15_v2  |   해제     |   D15_v2 and D15i_v2 |    
|   D15_v2  |   설정  |   D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |    
|   D14_v2  |   설정  |   D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |    
 
Likewise for Dsv2 series.
 
### <a name="q-i-want-to-purchase-additional-reserved-instances-for-dv2-which-one-should-i-choose"></a>Q: I want to purchase additional Reserved Instances for Dv2. Which one should I choose?
**A**: All RIs purchased after Nov 18, 2019, have the following behavior. 

| RI |  Instance Size Flexibility | Benefit eligibility |   
| --- | --- | --- |
| D15_v2 |  해제 |   D15_v2 only  
| D15_v2 |  설정 |    D15_v2 series will receive the RI benefit. The new D15i_v2 will not be eligible for RI benefit from this RI type. | 
| D15i_v2 |     해제 | D15i_v2 only |  
| D15i_v2 |     설정  | D15i_v2 only | 
 
Instance Size Flexibility cannot be used to apply to any other sizes such as D2_v2, D4_v2, or D15_v2. Likewise, for Dsv2 series.  
 
### <a name="q-can-i-buy-a-new-3-year-ri-for-d15i_v2-and-ds15i_v2"></a>Q: Can I buy a new 3-year RI for D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2?
**A**: Unfortunately no, only 1-year RI is available for new purchase.
 
### <a name="q-can-i-move-my-existing-d15_v2ds15_v2-reserve-instance-to-an-isolated-size-reserved-instance"></a>Q: Can I move my existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserve Instance to an isolated size Reserved Instance?
**A**: This is not necessary since the benefit will apply to both isolated and non-isolated sizes. But Azure will support changing existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserved Instances to D15i_v2/DS15i_v2. For all other Dv2/Dsv2 Reserved Instances, use the existing Reserved Instance or buy new Reserved Instances for the isolated sizes.

### <a name="q-im-a-azure-service-fabric-customer-relying-on-the-silver-or-gold-durability-tiers-does-this-change-impact-me"></a>Q: I'm a Azure Service Fabric Customer relying on the Silver or Gold Durability Tiers. Does this change impact me?
**A**: 아니요. The guarantees provided by Service Fabric's [Durability Tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#the-durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) will continue to function even after this change. If you require physical hardware isolation for other reasons, you may still need to take one of the actions described above.
